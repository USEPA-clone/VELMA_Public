*** DataInputs README ***

The DataInputs folder has the VELMA input data needs listed by category.

Each folder starts with a "m" manditory or "o'for optional. 
> A "m" folder data input means VELMA requires that data in order to carry out the simulation. 
  > Some "m" folders have multiple subfolders. That indicates there are optional ways to meet that required data need.
> A "o" folder data input means VELMA can utilize that data in order to carry out the simulation, but does not require the data to initialize and function. Optional data though does mean that data allowed VELMA to carry out some functionality that is not part of a default VELMA setup. Certain VELMA functions will require that data in order to perform.
