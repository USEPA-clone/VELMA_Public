            h1 VI. Steps for Configuring All Parameters TOC Sections 0.0 - 25.0
            hr
            h2#0-0 Overview of the All Parameters Table of Contents (TOC)
            hr
            p The "All Parameters Table of Contents" (TOC) provides users with a logical sequence of steps for creating a newsimulator configuration, or for quickly locating and calibrating parameters for existing configurations.
            p To access the All Parameter TOC, click the GUI's "All Parameters" tab, then click the drop-down button (<img width="19" height="24" alt="image" src="public/Image_028.gif" />) located on the right side of the4-window filter field (don't confuse this button with the one located next to the leftmost filter field):
            li <img width="627" height="393" alt="image" src="public/Image_029.jpg" />
            p That drop-down menu that appears is designed to organize subsets of model parameters in a "Table of Contents"format. The screenshot above shows the first page of the All Parameters TOC. Additional pages can be viewed byholding your mouse cursor over the TOC and scrolling down.
            p In all, the TOC includes 26 main sections (0.0 - 25.0), each of which addresses a particular simulationconfiguration procedure.
            p The All Parameters TOC is designed to:
            ul 
                li Provide a structured step-by-step guide for building a new simulator configuration.
                li Help users quickly make specific adjustments to an existing simulator configuration, for example, to change thedirectory path and/or folder name for input and output files, or to calibrate a particular subset of parametersfor a hydrological or biogeochemical process.
            br
            

            h2#1-0 1.0 All Configuration Parameters 
            p Using the drop down button on the right side of the filter field select <i>All Configuration Parameters</i> from the <i>All Parameters </i>menu.
            img(width="626" height="389" alt="image" src="public/Image_033.jpg")
            p This view displays all <i>Groups</i>, <i>Items</i>, <i>Parameters </i>and <i>Values </i>for a simulator configuration in a single, scrollable view. To see a pop-up description of any <i>Group</i>, <i>Item </i>or <i>Parameter </i>in any cell, hover the mouse cursor over the cell.
            h3 Alternatively, these descriptions are summarized here in an Excel file located here: 
            h4 Filename: 
            code VELMA 2.0_Description of Calibration Parameters.xlsx;
            h4 Folder location: 
            code VELMA Model\Supporting Documents\Excel Calibration Files
            p The <i>All Configuration Parameters </i>view contains an overwhelming amount of information, but the user has some search options for organizing and selecting things of interest. Experienced users may find that any of the first three search options, below, are useful for finding a specific parameter of interest in an existing simulator configuration.
            ol 
                li Option 1 - For some purposes it is useful to use the <i>All Configuration Parameters </i>view to locate, sort and select parameters of interest. For example, you can sort columns by double clicking the <i>Group</i>, <i>Item</i>, <i>Parameter </i>or <i>Value </i>column headers (turquois). You can also right click a particular cell and select "Set Column Filter to cellname", which will display values for the selected item across all cover types, soil types, disturbance type, etc. For example, this is useful if your watershed has more than one cover or soil type.
                li Option 2 - Use the drop-down buttonimg(width="19" height="24" alt="image"src="public/Image_034.gif") p on the right side of the first filter field (above <i>Group</i>) toselect from the list of model configuration categories: startups, calibration, cover, disturbance,cellDataWriter, spatailDataWriter, soil, and weather (the meaning and use of these categories will be explained below, under sections 1.0 to 25.0).
                img(width="629" height="274" alt="image" src="public/Image_035.jpg")
                li Option 3 - Type a search string in the filter fields located above any of the four turquois column headers. Suppose you want to make sure the nitrogen fixation subroutine is turned off for a coniferous cover type. As the screenshot below shows, by typing ".*Conifer in the "Item" filter field and ".*NitrogenFixation" in the "Parameter" filter field. This search verified that the "useNitrogenFixation" parameter is turned off (false).
                img(width="626" height="136" alt="image" src="public/Image_036.jpg")
                li Option 4 (recommended) - Although experienced users may find Options 1 - 3 handy for quickly locating specific Items, Parameters or Values, we recommend that all users stick with using sections 1.0 - 25.0 of the All Parameters TOC when configuring a new VELMA application. These sections collectively contain the same information listed under "All Configuration Parameters", but in asequence of steps organized to assist users in building new simulator configurations or editing existing ones. Details follow.

                    td.param_name inputDataLocationDirName:
                    td.param_desc The name of a subdirectory of the inputDataLocationRootName directory that contains the set of input data for a specific simulation run. When left unspecified or commented-out defaults to &quot;&quot;. (I.e. VELMA will look for input data in the inputDataLocationRootName directory itself)
                tr 
                    td.param_name inputDataLocationRootName 
                    td.param_desc Fully-qualified path to the directory containing input data directories. When left unspecified or commented-out defaults to the &quot;../data/&quot; subdirectory of VELMA&#39;s installation directory.
            p For the inputDataLocationRootName parameter, specify a directory name for the folder that contains the set of input data for a given simulation configuration. The inputDataLocationRootName is the <u>path</u> tothat directory.
            h2#2-0 2.0 - Results Data Location
            p For the <i>initializeOutputDataLocationRoot </i>parameter, specify the root directory under which VELMA will place simulation output files for a particular model run.
            img(width="627" height="106" alt="image" src="public/Image_038.jpg")

            table
                tr 
                    td.param_name initializeOutputDataLocationRoot 
                    td.param_desc Root directory under which to place per-simulation-run directories. If this property is left unspecified per- simulation-run directories for output files will be placedunderneath a default root created in the ../data subdirectory of the VELMA simulator&#39;s installationdirectory. When specified this property must be a fully- qualified path name. Whitespace in the name does nothave to be escape-delimited or double-quoted and the &quot;/&quot; can (and should!) be used as the pathseparator for both Unix and Windows paths. EXAMPLE: initializeOutputDataLocationRoot = C:/MyVelmaResults/VelmaResultsRoot For the above example subdirectories for each VELMA simulator run are placed underneath the directory &quot;C:/My VelmaResults/VelmaResultsRoot/&quot;
            h3#2-1 2.1 - Results Data Directory Name (Results data placed in directory with this name)
            p Specify a unique simulation filename in the value column for the <i>run_index </i>parameter.
            img(width="630" height="104" alt="image" src="public/Image_039.jpg")

                    td.param_desc Watershed Name (used as core name for the simulation model run data files).
            p Use this parameter to specify a unique name for each simulation run that you do. For example, a useful run_indexname might include the watershed name, date and other identifiers that will make it easier to determine when asimulation configuration was built and how it differs from others. VELMA will use the run_index name to create:
            ul
                li - the <i>Simulation Run Name </i>listed in the upper left corner of the <i>Run Parameters </i>GUI
                li - the .XML file name that VELMA writes when the user saves a configuration file ("Ctrl-S", or "File/SaveConfiguration To VELMA XML File" using the menu at the top of the <i>Run Parameters </i>GUI). This XML filecontains all parameter names and values for the saved configuration. VELMA will not save this information if theuser does not save it in an XML file;
                li - the name of the subdirectory (along with the full path) to which model output data files are written.
            
            h3#2-2 2.2 - Results Directory Logfile Names
            p Specify a filename in the Value column for the globalStateLogFilename parameter.
            img(width="624" height="121" alt="image" src="public/Image_040.jpg")
            h4 Parameter Definitions
            table
                tr 
                    td.param_name globalStateLogFilename 
                    td.param_desc The name of the global log file. The Global log file records console messages emitted during a simulation run. When left blank (&quot;&quot;) or commented-out no global logfile is created.
                tr 
                    td.param_name csvTraceLogFilename 
                    td.param_desc The name of the trace log file. The trace log file records any low-level debugging messages emitted during a simulation run. When left blank (&quot;&quot;) or commented-out notrace log file is created.
            p VELMA will use the globalStateLogFilename to record the stream of runtime console messages (see Consoletab) generated during a simulation run. This is optional, but we recommend creating a globalStateFileNameto help identify any problems with the simulator configuration file. For example, the console messagesrecorded in the globalStateLogFilename provide a complete, sequential log of runtime information aboutsuccessful or unsuccessful loading of input files, activation of disturbance events (harvest, fertilization,etc.), saving results to output directories/files, and so on.

            h2#3-0 3.0 - Spatial Dimensions and DEM File
            p The VELMA simulator requires a DEM file in order to run a simulation. The simulator also assumes that all otherspatial data files (discussed below) contain spatial data with the same overall (row and column) and cell(pixel) size dimensions as the DEM file. We highly recommend that the DEM used for VELMA simulations bepre-processed using the JPDEM software, rather than by other available "flat-processor" software (see Appendix7).The VELMA simulation configuration parameter that specifies the name of the DEM file is:
            table
                tr 
                    td.param_name input_dem example: 
                    td.param_desc SmallWatershed_10m.asc
            p The VELMA simulation configuration parameters that define the DEM file's location are:
            table 
                tr 
                    td.param_name InputDataLocationRootName 
                    td.param_desc example: CoastalSite
                tr 
                    td.param_name inputDataLocationDirName 
                    td.param_desc example: C:\VelmaInputData
            h3 Note that:
            ul 
                li Input_dem and inputDataLocationRootName are single file or directory names, while inputDataLocationDirName specifies a complete directory path.
                li When a simulation is started, the DEM data is loaded from inputDataLocationRootName/inputDataLocationDirName/input_dem
                li The DEM File's Dimensions are NOT Set Automatically by the Simulator or GUI
                li The VELMA simulator does not read the DEM file's dimensions from the DEM file's header!
            p As part of parameterizing a VELMA simulation configuration, you must manually determine (usually by viewing theDEM file's header rows with a text editor) the DEM file dimensions, and set the corresponding VELMA simulationparameters (usually by using the JVelma GUI)
            p This table lists the header rows of a DEM (Grid ASCII) file and the corresponding VELMA simulation parameters:
            
            table
                tr
                    td Grid ASCII Header Item
                    td VELMA Simulation Configuration Parameter
                tr    
                    td ncols
                    td Ncol
                tr
                    td nrows    
                    td Nrow
                tr
                    td xllcorner
                    td cellOffsetX
                tr
                    td yllcorner
                    td cellOffsetY
                tr
                    td cellsize
                    td cell
                tr
                    td nodata_value
                    td 
                
            
            p Sections 3.1 - 3.3 provide details on configuring these parameters for a DEM file.
            p Note: if you change the DEM file that a simulation is configured to use (i.e. you change the DEM filename for theinput_dem parameter) then you must ensure that all of the parameters above are updated as well.
            h3#3-1 3.1 - DEM Row and Column Counts
            p Specify values for the ncol and nrow parameters based on the DEM grid ASCII header items in thetable above.
            img(width="628" height="135" alt="image" src="public/Image_041.jpg")
            h3#3-2 3.2 - DEM Cell Size (Assumes a square cell, i.e. Width and Height equal)
            p Specify the value of the cell parameter.
            img(width="630" height="102" alt="image" src="public/Image_042.jpg")
            p This describes the xy-dimension in meters of individual cells in the DEM grid ASCII file. In this example, eachcell is 10x10 meters. The choice of DEM cell size will depend upon the set of questions a user wishes toaddress. For example, applications focusing on the effect of riparian buffer width on nutrient export to streamsmay require relatively small cells (e.g., 10 meters), compared to applications focusing on ecosystem carbondynamics (e.g., 100 meters). Obviously, an application's total number of cells (and consequent simulation time)increases with the square of the ratio of alternative cell sizes - e.g., (100/10)2 = 100 times more cellsfor 10m versus 100m cell sizes. In any case, the specified cell size must be consistent with the DEM cell size.That is, the user cannot arbitrarily adjust the cell size parameter without telling VELMA to load a DEM havingthe same cell size (see All Parameters 3.0). Furthermore, the DEM used must be "flat- processed" for thespecified cell size using the JPDEM tool. The executable JPDEM.jar, a JPDEM user manual, and backgroundinformation (Pan et al. 2012) can be found here: VELMA Model\JPDEM_DEM Processor. The JPDEM user manual is alsoincluded in Appendix 7 of this manual.
            h3#3-3 3.3 - Watershed Outlet (X and Y coordinates are Column and Row indices)
            p Specify the value of the outx and outy parameters. These describe the watershed outlet cell's X andY coordinates (column index) relative to the DEM upper-left corner. The watershed outlet cell coordinates are determined using the JPDEM tool.
            img(width="619" height="115" alt="image" src="public/Image_043.jpg")
            h2#4-0 4.0 - Soil Types
            p VELMA requires information on key soil properties affecting hydrological and biogeochemical processes within astudy watershed. Whether single or multiple soil types are modeled within a watershed, you will need toestablish a soil type map and specify parameter values for a set of soil properties associated with each soiltype. The following steps will accomplish this:
            ul 
                li Establish a soil ID map describing the assignment of soil type IDs for every cell within the delineatedwatershed. See section 4.1 for details.
                li Specify soil ID parameter names and values corresponding to those appearing in the soil ID map. See section 4.2for details.
                li Specify soil depth values for the entire soil column and for each of four soil layers within the column. Seesection 4.3 for details.
                li Specify soil hydraulic conductivity values controlling infiltration rate (Ks), and depth dependent changes invertical and lateral macropore flow, Ksv and Ksl, respectively. See section 4.4 for details.
            h3#4-1 4.1 - Soil ID Map File
            p The Soil ID Map File is specified by the <i>soilParametersIndexMapFileName </i>parameter. You can view and set itby selecting "4.1 Soil ID Map File" in the All Parameters outline drop-down selector:
            img(width="625" height="136" alt="image" src="public/Image_044.jpg")
            h4 Parameter Definitions
            table
                tr 
                    td.param_name soilParametersIndexMapFileName
                    td.param_desc The file name of a spatial-explicit map of Soil Parameters uniqueIds. The data in this map file specifies the Soil Parameterization of a given pixel in the DEMmap.
            p The file specified for the soilParametersIndexMapFileName is assumed to be a Grid ASCII (".asc") map filewith the same row and column dimensions as the simulation configuration's DEM file. Its contents should be integer values. Each cell's integer value should be the ID number of a soiltype.
            p Suppose the specified soil index map file contains three distinct integers for this map: 100, 105 and 110. TheVELMA simulation will expect the simulation configuration to include 3 soil parameterizations.
            h3#4-2 4.2 - Soil IDs and Names
            p Adding a Soil Parameterization to a simulation configuration using the following steps. Click the Edit Soil Parameterizations "Add a New Soil Parameterization" menu item:
            img(width="625" height="193" alt="image" src="public/Image_045.jpg")
            p Clicking "Add a New Soil Parameterization" opens the Soil Parameterization Name and ID dialog which looks likethis:
            img(width="400" height="137" alt="image" src="public/Image_046.jpg")
            p Enter a name and ID number for your new Soil Parameterization.
            p The name must be unique (i.e. no other Soil Parameterization already specified for this simulation configurationcan share the name you specify) and we recommend avoiding whitespace and punctuation characters (e.g. "(" and")") apart from the underbar ("_") character, which can be used instead of whitespace.
            p The ID number must be an integer, not already specified for any existing Soil Parameterization, and must matchone of the integers that appears in the Soil ID Map File.
            p As an example: Suppose we are adding the first Soil Parameterization ("100") for the hypothetical Soil ID MapFile mentioned above, and that ID "100" identifies cells that contain loamy sand.
            p Acceptable names (it's guaranteed unique because it's the first Soil Parameterization we're adding) might be:"Loamy_Sand" or "Soil_100_LoamySand", or something similar.
            p However, the only acceptable ID value is "100" - because the Unique Soil ID # of this parameterization is whatkeys it to those particular cells in the Soil ID Map File.
            p Once you've entered valid name and ID values in the Name and ID dialog, click the OK button. When you click OK,the VELMA GUI adds a new Soil Parameterization to the simulation configuration, and sets the All Parameterstab's filters to display only the parameters of the newly-added Soil Parameterization. Assuming we named our newSoil Parameterization "Loamy_Sand", with ID = "100", this is what the All Parameters tab would look like afterclicking OK:
            img(width="624" height="193" alt="image" src="public/Image_047.jpg")
            p We did one other thing to get the above display: notice that the "Parameter" column is circled, and has a"down-arrow" indicating "descending-sort". After clicking OK to add the new Soil Parameterization, we clickedthe "Parameter" header field (twice), which sorts the table of properties on that column.
            p Now go to <i>All Parameters 4.3 </i>and <i>4.4 </i>where parameter values for each soil name/ID will need to bespecified for total soil column depth, thickness of each of four soil layers, and hydrologic parametersaffecting vertical and lateral flow.
            h3#4-3 4.3 - Soil Depth Values
            p There are two methods, direct or indirect, that can be used to specify soil layer depths. The direct and indirectmethods have their own distinct set of parameters that are available to each soil type specified for a givensimulation configuration. Each method has its advantages. Thus, it is up to the user to decide which one to use.Either the direct or indirect set of parameters can be applied to a specified soil type, independent of whichset is applied in other specified soil types.
            h3#4-3-1 4.3.1 - Soil Depth Direct Specification
            p The direct method (optional) for setting a soil type's layer thicknesses uses a comma-separated list of valuesfor the setSoilLayerThicknesses parameter in millimeters for of each of 4 soil layers. For example:&quot;500, 500, 500, 1500&quot; (without the quote-marks) specifies the soil type's 4
            p layers as being 500 mm, 500 mm 500 mm, and 1500 mm thick, from layer 1 to layer 4, respectively.
            img(width="629" height="118" alt="image" src="public/Image_048.jpg")
            h4 Parameter Definitions
            table
                tr 
                    td.param_name setSoilLayerThicknesses
                    td.param_desc A comma-separated list of values specifying the thickness of each soil layer in millimeters. For example: &quot;500 750 1000 1500&quot; (without the quote-marks) specifiesthe soil&#39;s 4 layers as being 500 mm 750 mm 1000 mm and 1500 mm thick from layer 1 to layer 4 respectively.NOTE: This list of values may be left unspecified. When setSoilLayerThickness is unspecified thesoil&#39;s layer thicknesses are set by the combination of the soilColumnDepth and setSoilLayerWeightsparameters. When setSoilLayerThickness is specified the soilColumnDepth and setSoilLayerWeightsparameters are ignored.
            p Thus, for the direct method, VELMA internally calculates the value for the <i>soilColumnDepth </i>parameter fromthe setSoilLayerThicknesses values specified for layers 1, 2, 3 and 4. When setSoilLayerThicknessesis not specified (left blank), the indirect method must be used to specify the soil layer thicknesses andsoil column depth (see All Parameters 4.32).
            h3#4-3-2 4.3.2 - Soil Depth Indirect Specification
            p As an alternative to the direct method described under <i>All Parameters 4.31</i>, you can instead use theindirect method for specifying a soil type's total soil column depth (parameter = soilColumnDepth, inmillimeters) and soil layer depth (parameter = setSoilLayerWeights, which is equal to the fraction "soillayer thickness / soil column depth".

            p In this example the soil type named "SoilWedge1" has soilColumnDepth = 2000 mm, and setSoilLayerWeights= 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25 for layers 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. VELMA uses these values during asimulation to compute each soil layer's thickness (in millimeters) as:
            p.math layerThickness[iLayer] = soilColumnDepth * soilLayerWeight[iLayer].
            p Thus, the parameter values shown in the above example translate to soil layer thicknesses of 500 mm, 500 mm, 500mm, and 500 mm for each layer.
            p When setColumnDepth and setSoilLayerWeights are not specified (left blank), the direct method mustbe used to specify the soil layer thicknesses and soil column depth (see All Parameters 4.31).
            h3#4-4 4.4 - Soil Ks Values
            p VELMA simulates vertical and lateral water drainage using a logistic function that is intended to capture thebreakthrough characteristics of soil water movement. The logistic function provides a simple way (3 parameters)to capture the fast "switching" from low to high flow as water storage within a soil layer approaches fieldcapacity. VELMA offers two alternative methods, direct or indirect, for specifying these parameters. However,because the direct method is still under development, we recommend that users use the indirect method (see <i>All Parameters 4.4.2</i>).
            h3#4-4-1 4.4.1 - Soil Ks Values Direct Specification
            p Under development - please use the indirect method described in the next section.
            h3#4-4-2 4.4.2 - Soil Ks Values Indirect Specification
            p We refer to this method as an "indirect&quot; because VELMA internally uses the specified soil Ks parametervalues to calculate the actual soil lateral and vertical hydraulic conductivity (Ks) values used during thesimulation run. You must specify values for 3 parameters for each soil type (in this example, "SoilWedge1"refers to a particular soil type / map unit).

            h4 Calibration Notes
            p As a starting point, we recommend using the texture-specific values listed in</a>Table 1 for "Surface Ks" and other physical characteristics of soil. Note that all the    values in Table 1can vary significantly as a result of compaction, presence of hard pans, and other    factors.
            p Based on the parameter values specified, VELMA computes the Ks lateral and Ks vertical flows (mm/day) per eachsoil layer as
            div.math_formula 
                p.math ksLateral[ilayer] = surfaceKs * e^{ ksLateralExponentialDecayFactor * \sum{layers[iLayer]*0.5} }
                p.math ksVertial[ilayer] = surfaceKs * e^{ ksVerticalExponentialDecayFactor * \sum{layers[iLayer]*0.5} }
            p Iterative calibration of the user-specified parameter values is generally required to obtain a good fit betweensimulated and observed stream discharge (mm/day) at the watershed outlet. At the end of each simulation, VELMAcalculates a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient to assess the goodness-of-fit and reports the results in asimulation output file named "NashSutcliffeCoefficients.txt".
                a(href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash%E2%80%93Sutcliffe_model_efficiency_coefficient") See Nash-Sutcliffe wikipedia 
            p for a general overview of the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and its application. Quoting that website:
            p "Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies can range from -&infin; to 1. An efficiency of 1 (E = 1) corresponds to a perfect match ofmodeled discharge to the observed data. An efficiency of 0 (E = 0) indicates that the model predictions are asaccurate as the mean of the observed data, whereas an efficiency less than zero (E &lt; 0) occurs when theobserved mean is a better predictor than the model."
            p In general, a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.7 is considered a good fit between simulated and observeddischarge. A value of 0.8 or greater is excellent, particularly for spatially-distributed ecohydrological modelslike VELMA that simulate the processes and flow paths by which water arrives at the watershed outlet (empiricalmodels do not have this requirement).
            p Advanced users can consult Appendix 6.1 (Abdelnour et al.    2011) for additional details concerning soil Ks equations, parameters and calibration.
            h3#4-5 4.5 - Soil Other Hydrologic Parameters
            p VELMA simulates the effect of several soil physical properties on water retention, rates of drainage and otherhydrological processes. These physical properties and their associated parameter names are
            ul 
                li Soil porosity (parameter name = porosityFraction): the fraction of void space (v/v) in a soil.
                li Soil field capacity (parameter name = fieldCapacity): the amount of soil moisture (v/v) held insoil after excess water has drained away and the rate of downward movement has materially decreased
                li Wilt Point (parameter name = wiltPoint): the minimal point of soil moisture (v/v) the plantrequires not to wilt.
                li Bulk density (parameter name = bulkDensity): the dry weight of soil per unit volume of soil(g/cm3).
            h4 The following table provides typical values for these parameters for 11 soil texture classes(surface Ks, described above in All Parameters 4.4, is included here as well). The values listedare offered here as a starting point for model initialization. However, users should be aware thatthese values can vary dramatically as a result of compaction, presence of hard pans, and otherfactors.

            h4 IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR SECTIONS 5.0 - 25.0 OF THE ALL PARAMETERS TOC
            p VELMA version 2.0 simulates plant biomass and detritus much differently than VELMA version 1.0. Version 1.0 useda simplified Plant Soil Model (PSM, Stieglitz et al. 2006) to simulate plant biomass in each cell in aggregate -that is, leaves, stems and roots were lumped together in a single biomass pool (Abdelnour et al. 2011). Thislumped approach greatly simplified the structure and application of the model. Version 1.0 successfullysimulates important aspects of catchment hydrology and biogeochemistry (e.g., Abdelnour et al. 2011, 2013), butit does not simulate effects associated with phenological changes and disturbances that disproportionatelyaffect specific plant tissues - for example, leaf growth and senescence, defoliation events, selective removalof high or low C/N tissues via harvest or grazing, etc. These effects can have important implications forassessments involving water quality and quantity, carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services.
            p To address such effects, VELMA version 2.0 simulates nitrogen pools and fluxes for four plant tissue types:leaves, aboveground stems, belowground stems (&gt;2 mm diameter), and fine roots (&lt; 2 mm
            p diameter). This new Leaf-Stem-Root (LSR) submodel includes live (biomass) and dead (detritus) pools for each ofthe four plant tissue types.
            p A carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio must be specified for each plant tissue type so that VELMA can estimate carbonpools and fluxes corresponding to modeled nitrogen pools and fluxes. Although the model parameterization allowsdifferent C/N values for the biomass and detritus pools of the same tissue type, at present, the plant biomassand detritus pools for each tissue type must have the same C/N ratio to maintain mass balance of C and N pools.Specification of distinct C/N ratios per tissue type will be addressed in future versions.
            p Several other features have been built into the LSR submodel.
            ol 
                li A new nonlinear mortality subroutine simulates the loss of live plant biomass    to detritus for all four tissues. See All Parameters section 12.0 for details. This replaces the mortality    subroutine in VELMA version 1.0 described in </a>Appendix 1, section A1.2.3.
                li A modified version of the decomposition subroutine of Potter et al. (1993) is    used to decompose detritus (leaf, stem and root) to humus (unidentifiable dead material). See All Parameters    section 13.0 for details. This replaces the decomposition subroutine in VELMA version 1.0 described in</a>Appendix 1, section A1.2.
                li The "ET recovery" subroutine (Abdelnour et al. 2011) has been revised to use    leaf biomass, rather than stand age, to simulate effects of forest regrowth on ET and streamflow. This    subroutine can be applied to any cover type. See All Parameters section 13.0 for details. This replaces the    decomposition subroutine in VELMA version 1.0 described in </a>Appendix 6.2, section B2.
                li A new subroutine describing age-related declines in transpiration of forest stands has been added. Abovegroundplant biomass is used as a proxy for stand age. See All Parameters section 10.3 for details.
            p The figure on the next page illustrates the structure of the new LSR submodel and its integration into theoverall Plant Soil Model. Additional Details on the LSR model structure, equations and parameterscan be found in &quot;</a>Appendix 1: Overview of VELMA'sLeaf-Stem-Root (LSR) Plant Biomass Submodel". We recommend reviewing this material before proceeding further, focusing on the LSR model structureand equations describing the various LSR nitrogen and carbon pools and fluxes.

            h2#5-0 5.0 - Cover Types
            p VELMA version 2.0 includes two major changes to the vegetation submodel:
            ol
                li Multiple cover types (forest, grassland, agricultural crops, etc.) within a watershed can now be modeled. Theversion 1.0 convention of one cover type per grid cell is maintained.
                li Plant biomass for each cover type is modeled using four plant tissues - leaves, aboveground stems,belowground stems, and roots - rather than as a single biomass pool.
            p Sections 5.1 - 5.3, below, discuss procedures for initializing a simulator configuration for one or more covertypes.
            p Sections 5.4 through 5.7, below, discuss procedures for initializing a simulator configuration for the four plantbiomass pools.
            h3#5-1 5.1 - Cover ID Map File
            p The VELMA program requires a set of Cover Species parameters for each Cover ID number that occurs in the Cover IDMap File. Each Cover ID corresponds to a distinct, user-defined Cover Species (cover type) - for example,hardwood forest, grassland, corn cropland, and so forth.
            p This section describes the Cover ID map file and associated parameter specifications.
            p The Cover ID Map File is specified by the <i>coverSpeciesIndexMapFileName </i>parameter. You can view and set itby selecting "All Parameters 5.1 Cover ID Map File" from the All Parameters outline drop-down menu:
            img(width="624" height="134" alt="image" src="public/Image_054.jpg")
            p The file specified for the <i>coverSpeciesIndexMapFileName </i>is assumed to be a grid ASCII (".asc") map filewith the same row and column dimensions as the simulation configuration's DEM file. Its contents should beinteger values. Each cell's integer value should be the ID number of a cover type.
            p Suppose the specified cover index map file contains three distinct integers: 5, 7 and 9. For this map, the VELMAsimulation will expect the simulation configuration to include 3 Cover Species.
            p You will need to add a new Cover Species to a simulation configuration using the following steps:
            ol
                li Click Edit  Cover Species  "Add a New Cover Species" menu item. This will cause a pop-up menuto appear (see step 2).
                    img(width="620" height="177" alt="image" src="public/Image_055.jpg")
            h3#5-3 5.3 - Cover IDs and Names
            p [Note: All Parameters 5.2 - Cover Age Map File has been moved below section 5.3 to reflect therequired workflow]
            p Picking up from All Parameters 5.2, step (2)…
                li Enter a name and ID number for your new Cover Species. The name must be unique (i.e. no other Cover Species already specified for this simulation configuration canshare the name you specify) and we recommend avoiding whitespace and punctuation characters (e.g. "(" and ")")apart from the underbar ("_") character, which can be used instead of whitespace. The ID number must be an integer, not already specified for any existing Cover Species, and must match one of theintegers that appears in the Cover ID Map File.
            p As an example: Suppose we are adding the first Cover Species ("5") for the hypothetical Cover ID Map File mentioned above, andthat ID "5" identifies cells that contain Conifers. Acceptable names (guaranteed unique because this is the first Cover Species we're adding) might be: "Conifer" or"Cover_5_Conifer", or something similar. However, the only acceptable ID value is "5" - because the Unique Cover ID # of this parameterization is whatkeys it to those particular cells in the Cover ID Map File.
                li Once you've entered valid name and ID values in the Name and ID dialog, click the OK button. When you click OK, the VELMA GUI adds a new Cover Species Parameterization to the simulation configuration, andsets the All Parameters tab's filters to display only the parameters of the newly-added Cover Species. Assumingwe named our new Cover Species "Conifer", with ID = "5", this is what the All Parameters tab would look likeafter clicking OK:
                    img(width="624" height="295" alt="image" src="public/Image_056.jpg")
            p We did one other thing to get the above display: notice that the "Parameter" column is circled, and has a"down-arrow" indicating "descending-sort". After clicking OK to add the new Cover Species, we clicked the"Parameter" header field (twice), which sorts the table of properties on that column.
            h3 5.2 - Cover Age Map File
            h4 [Note: section 5.2 appears after section 5.3 to reflect the required workflow for developing a Cover Age Map fileand associated parameter values]
            p To enable scheduling of disturbance events during a simulation (per All Parameters section 24.0), VELMA needs tokeeps track of changes in the age (years) of vegetation from one calendar year to another, or as a result ofdisturbances that can reset stand age to 0 (e.g., by clearcutting) or to some other age (e.g., by selectivethinning of old trees that establishes understory vegetation as the new dominant age class). Note that cover agemaps can be can be applied to cover types other than forests, e.g., rangeland vegetation that may have a more diverse mixt ofspecies than vegetation recovering from a recent fire.
            p After you have established a Cover ID Map file (section 5.1) and specified Cover IDs and names for each CoverSpecies (section 5.3, above!), you will need to set up a Cover Age Map file and specify the file name.
            p The Cover Age Map file name is specified by the coverAgeMapFileName parameter. You can view and set it byselecting "All Parameters 5.2 Cover Age Map File" from the All Parameters outline drop-down menu:
            img(width="628" height="117" alt="image" src="public/Image_057.jpg")
            p The file specified for the coverAgeMapFileName is assumed to be a grid ASCII (".asc") map file with thesame row and column dimensions as the simulation configuration's DEM file. Its contents should be integer valuesreflecting the age of vegetation (Cover Species) occupying each grid cell. Each cell's integer value should bethe ID number of a Cover Species. For example, an age of 0 could be assigned to row crops (corn, soybeans,etc.). Cells in a forest landscape might range in age from 0 (newly burned or planted) to many centuries. TheVELMA team has used biomass-to-age and tree height-to-age relationships to establish Cover Age Maps.
            h3#5-4 5.4 - Cover Carbon-To-Nitrogen Ratios
            p This section is concerned with initializing plant tissue C/N ratios for plant biomass and detritus associatedwith leaves, aboveground stems (AgStem), belowground stems (BgStem) and roots. Thus, a total of eight C/N (CtoN)ratios must be specified for each cover type. Only one cover type (CoverForest_1) is displayed for the examplebelow. In addition, a C/N ratio must be specified for the humus pool.
            img(width="624" height="235" alt="image" src="public/Image_058.jpg")
            h3#5-5 5.5 - Cover Uniform-Cell Initialization Amounts
            p Using the <i>All Parameters </i>drop-down menu, select "5.5 Cover Uniform-Cell Initialization Amounts". Theparameters shown are used to specify initial pool sizes (<b>g C / m</b>2) that VELMA
            p requires at the start of each simulation run. Values must be specified for all plant biomass pools, detrituspools and humus pool associated with each cover type. The example below shows just one cover type, but the samelist of 9 parameters repeats for each additional cover type that has been has been for the simulationconfiguration.
            img(width="624" height="232" alt="image" src="public/Image_059.jpg")
            p "Cover Uniform-Cell Initialization Amounts" refers to the fact that all grid cells assigned to a particular covertype will have the same initial values for plant biomass, detritus and humus. Obviously this method will notwork for watersheds where there is significant spatial variability in pool sizes (e.g., where forest stands varyin age). In these situations, you can use All Parameters menu item "24.3 Disturbance Items Spatial Specifiers"to establish spatially variable initialization amounts for any or all pools.

            p VELMA uses the method of Gale and Grigal (1987) to vertically distribute a cover    type's specified total root biomass. This results in an exponentially decreasing amount of root biomass per    soil layer. See </a>Appendix 6.2 section A1.2.6 (Abdelnour et al. 2013) for a description    of VELMA's implementation of the Gale-Grigal root distribution function.

            p At this stage (section 5.7) of your simulation configuration, don't try to specify values for all the parameterslisted above. For now, just focus on the initial C and N pools for plant biomass anddetritus (highlighted in yellow, above). To specify initial C and N stocks(g/m2) for these pools, we recommend that you consult</a>Appendix 1 for an overview of VELMA's LSR submodel and it C and N pools and fluxes.Filling in C and N values for the various pools shown would be a good start.

            p The Default Weather Model provides uniform precipitation and air temperature values for all cells of asimulation's delineated watershed for each day of a simulation run, and includes a simple snow model.
            h4 A Default Weather Model is Provided Automatically in New Simulation Configurations
            p When you create a new simulation configuration in the VELMA GUI (Edit  "Create a New, EmptyConfiguration"), it automatically contains parameters for the default weather model. This weather model'smodelClass, uniqueName and uniqueId parameters are preset to valid, default values. You maychange those values if you wish, but there is no need to do so and we advise
            p you to leave them alone. You must provide the model with the names of data files for precipitation and airtemperature driver data, and parameterize the snow model.
            p You can focus the All Parameters tab's parameters table to various aspects of the simulation configuration'sweather model by selecting them in the tab's drop-down selector.
            p To view the complete core weather model parameterization, select "6.0 Weather Model":

            h4 You Must Provide the Weather Model with Rain and Air Temperature Driver Files.
            p The rain and air temperature driver files share the same format requirements: one floating-point value per line,with exactly one line for each day between the first day of the year specified by the simulation configuration'sforcing_start value, and the last day of the year specified by the simulation configuration's forcing_end value.For example, if a forcing start/end range of [2000 to 2001] would require each driver file to have 731 lines ofdata (corresponding to 366 + 365 days per year, accounting for the leap year), with one value per line.
            p You may omit the path of the driver file names you specify. The Velma simulator then assumes the file's locationis specified by the simulation configuration's input data location settings (set the outline selection to "1.0Input Data Selection" to review or set the input location). You may also provide a fully-qualified path + namefor a driver file. If you do, be sure to use "/" (forward-slash) characters as path-separators.

            p Each value in this file represents a day's precipitation (in millimeters) at each cell in simulation's thedelineated watershed. Because of the snow model, some of this precipitation may be rain, and some may be snow.The parameterization of the snow model determines the amounts of both.

            h4 A Summary Description of the Snow Model's Behavior
            p For each day of a simulation run, the daily air temperature and precipitation values are taken together with theabove snow model parameters and daily values are calculated for the following: Rain, Snow, Snow Depth andSnow Melt.
            p When air temperature is at or above the snowFormationTemperature, all the day's precipitation is countedas rain and becomes the day's Rain value. If the air temperature is also greater than thesnowMeltTemperature, the amount of snow that melts is calculated using the following equation:
            div.math_formula 
                p.math snowMeltRate * (airT - snowMeltTemperature) + rainOnSnowEffect * rain
            p where airT and rain are the day's air temperature and precipitation values respectively.
            p If there has been snow deposited into the Snow Depth value on previous simulation days (see below) the amount ofsnow melted is "deducted" from that value and becomes additional "rain" for the day. If the melted amount thatis computed exceeds the amount of snow depth, the entire amount (but no more) is "deducted".
            p When air temperature is below the snowFormationTemperature parameter, all the day's precipitation iscounted as snow and becomes the day's Snow value. The day's Snow mount is also added to the Snow Depth value.
            
            h3#6-3-1 6.3.1 - Weather Model Coefficients Files (Only Spatial Weather)
            p VELMA's default weather model (described under section 6.0 - 6.2) does not address spatial variations intemperature and precipitation associated with topographic features - elevation, slope, aspect and cold airdrainages.
            p VELMA's optional Spatial Weather Model provides differing precipitation and air temperature values foreach cell of a simulation's delineated watershed for each day of a simulation run. It includes the same simplesnow model as the Default Weather Model.
            div.caution_box.warning-base
                h4 CAUTION!
                p The Spatial Weather Model is still somewhat experimental and undergoing testing and refinement.p Also, it requires more effort to configure/parameterize than the Default Weather Model. For both of these    reasons, we currently recommend using only the Default Weather Model unless you <i>must </i>have the more    complex behavior that the Spatial Weather Model provides, e.g, for mountainous terrain.
            h4 You Must Explicitly Specify Activation of the Spatial Weather Model
            p When you create a new simulation configuration, the VELMA GUI automatically adds a Default Weather Modelparameters group to it. If you wish to use the Spatial Weather Model instead, Click the Edit  "SetWeather Model  "Spatial Weather Model" menu item:
            img(width="625" height="178" alt="image" src="public/Image_067.jpg")
            p When you set the weather model to "Spatial Weather Model", the VELMA GUI removes any pre-existing weather modelparameters and adds the parameters group for the Spatial Weather Model.
            p You can focus the All Parameters tab's parameters table to various aspects of the simulation configuration'sweather model by selecting them in the tab's outline drop-down selector.
            p The VELMA GUI automatically provides valid default values for the Spatial Weather Model's

            h4 You Must Provide the Weather Model with Rain and Air Temperature Driver Files
            p The Spatial Weather Model derives daily rain and air temperature values for every cell in the simulationwatershed by applying functions to the daily rain and air temperature values of one specific cell (the "Primary"or "Prime" Cell) within the watershed. You must provide the data file names for rain and air temperature dataobserved for this Prime Cell, as well as its x-and-y coordinates as part of the Spatial Weather Model'sparameterization.
            p Set the xPrimeCell and yPrimeCell parameter's values to the Prime Cell's x (column) and y (row)location.
            p Set the rainDriverDataFileName and airTemperatureDriverDataFileName to the file names of theprecipitation and air temperature files, respectively.
            p You may omit the path of the driver file names you specify. The Velma simulator then assumes the file's locationis specified by the simulation configuration's input data location settings (set the outline selection to "1.0Input Data Selection" to review or set the input location). You may also provide a fully-qualified path + namefor a driver file. If you do, be sure to use "/" (forward-slash) characters as path-separators.
            p The rain and air temperature driver files share the same format requirements: one floating-point value per line,with exactly one line for each day between the first day of the year specified by the simulation configuration'sforcing_start value, and the last day of the year specified by the simulation configuration's forcing_endvalue. For example, if a forcing start/end range of [2000 to 2001] would require each driver file to have731 lines of data, with one value per line.
            h4 You Must Provide Files of Coefficients for Precipitation and Air Temperature Calculations The Spatial WeatherModel calculates the day's precipitation and air temperature values for a given cell location by applying aprecipitation or air temperature function to the day's driver precipitation or air temperature value. Thesefunctions map/modify the "seed" value at the Prime Cell to derive a value for the other cells. The functionstake into account the cell's
            p elevation, flow accumulation and heat index values, and the equations involved require per- month coefficientsfor each term of their equations.
            h4 You Must provide the file names (or optionally full path + names) of one file for rain (precipitation) equationcoefficients and one file of air temperature coefficients.

            h4 The Spatial and Default Weather Model Both Employ the Same Snow Model Parameterization of the Spatial WeatherModel's snow (sub)model is exactly the same as that of the Default Weather Model's. See the Default WeatherModel's documentation for the details.
            p The difference between the two is that the Spatial Weather Model first calculates the precipitation and airtemperature values <i>for the specific cell </i>before applying the snow model's mechanism to determine theday's rain, snow, snow depth and snow melt values. In contrast, the Default Weather Model presents the same(driver) precipitation and air temperature values to the snow model at every cell location in the simulation'swatershed.
            h3#6-4 6.4 - Latitude/Longitude
            p The VELMA simulator computes a daily solar radiation value for the latitude and longitude specified by thedeg_lat and deg_lon parameter values. Set the values of these parameters to the latitude andlongitude of your simulation configuration's location. Use decimal degrees, NOT "degrees, minutes, seconds"format for the values. For example:

            h3#6-5 6.5 - Solar Radiation
            p In addition to latitude and longitude, VELMA's solar radiation equation requires values for the followingparameters:
            table
                tr
                    td isc

            p The VELMA GUI automatically provides default values for each of these parameters; these may be acceptable foryour simulation location.
            p NOTE: Solar radiation parameters are intended for use in computing plant nitrogen uptake and snow melt. Althoughthese modeling capabilities are under development, VELMA 2.0 currently does not include them. That being thecase you may leave the solar radiation parameters set to their default values without affecting your simulationrun results.
            h3#6-6 6.6 - Soil Layer Temperature
            p Soil temperature is used in many of VELMA's subroutines, for example, to compute    rates of soil organic matter decomposition, plant nitrogen uptake, nitrification, and many other temperature    sensitive processes. Documentation describing the equations and methods for computing subsurface temperature    per VELMA's four soil layers can be found in </a>Appendix 6.2 section A1.1.
            p For the soil temperature subroutine to work properly for your simulation site, you need to:
            ul 
                li provide a daily mean air temperature file (see "Required Input Data Files for VELMA Simulations")
                li specify values for total soil depth and soil bulk density (see All Parameters sections 4.3 and 4.5,respectively)
                li and specify the average annual air temperature for your site (avgAT), as follows:
            img(width="620" height="107" alt="image" src="public/Image_072.jpg")
            h2#7-0 7.0 - Initialize Uniform Water Amount per Cell </a><u>(link to All Parameters    TOC)</u> Because soil moisture can vary significantly in space and time, it would be extremely difficult tospecify realistic soil moisture amounts for every soil layer in every cell within a watershed. A
            p more practical method is to specify a uniform amount of initial soil moisture for all layers and
            p cells, and then allow these initial values to adjust to realistic levels during a "spin up" period of years priorto the simulated years of interest.
            p By default, VELMA set the initial water content of all cells and layers to the field capacity value specified foreach soil type. , i.e., when the parameter initialUniformSoilMoisture is set to its default value of -1(if it is set to any other value, reset it to -1).
            img(width="623" height="106" alt="image" src="public/Image_073.jpg")
            h4 Calibration Notes
            p We recommend using this default option, and that you also discard the first year of simulation results, andpossibly more, until soil moisture levels have sufficient time to "spin up" to your site's observed conditions.Shallow soils may adjust within a year or two, whereas deep soils may require decades before simulatedgroundwater tables reach observed levels. You will need to experiment with this to determine how many spin-upyears are required.
            p To set up a spin-up period, you can instruct VELMA to perform one or more simulation "loops" for the set of yearsincluded in the climate input files. To do this, specify the desired "Number of Loops" in Run Parameters tab ofthe simulator's GUI. For the example shown below, 3 loops are specified, meaning that the 5 years (1999 - 2003)of available climate driver data will be repeated (looped) 3 times for this simulation.
            img(width="622" height="168" alt="image" src="public/Image_074.jpg")
            p Thus, VELMA will generate 3 loops x 5 years = 15 years of model output, for which the first 2 loops (10 spin-upyears) can be discarded.
            p An alternative method to accomplish the same thing would be to edit the temperature and precipitation driverfiles, such that a copy of the years you want to use for spin-up purposes appears at the beginning of theoriginal climate record (remember to rename the edited climate driver files to reflect the spin-up number ofyears).
            h2#8-0 8.0 - Chemistry Pools (Dissolved C and N) </a>(link to All </a>Parameters TOC) VELMA simulates ecosysteminputs, outputs and internal cycling of four pools of dissolved nitrogen and carbon in soil: ammonium(NH4), nitrate (NO3), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON)
            p and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
            p Sections 8.1 and 8.2, below, describe the specification of initial pools and calibration of parameterscontrolling leaching losses to streams. Subsequent sections describe additional processes affecting inputs andoutputs from these dissolved C and N pools.

            h4 Calibration Notes
            p On day 1 of a simulation, VELMA will use the specified parameter values to calculate the fraction of eachnutrient's total pool to allocate to each of the four soil layers. This is done uniformly for all grid cells onday 1.
            p With some effort, VELMA can be calibrated to simulate spatial variability in C, N, H2O pools and fluxes.With a well-calibrated parameter set, initially uniform nutrient pool values will begin to adjust and, after asufficient spin-up time, more closely match spatial and temporal patterns of observed nutrient pools (McKane2014).
            p Section 7.0 describes methods for setting up an appropriate spin-up period for allowing initialized soil moisturelevels to adjust to a site's biophysical conditions. The same spin-up method applies for all model pools andfluxes, including stream chemistry.
            p Alternatively, you can use a more advanced method for specifying initial nutrient pool values that consider spatial variability in soil types, and cover species type and age.    Details can be found in </a>Appendix 3: Creating Initial ASCII Grid Chemistry Spatial DataPools.

            h4 Calibration Notes
            p The "qf" parameters for specifying nutrient loss fractions are very important for achieving a good fit betweensimulated and observed stream chemistry data (Abdelnour et al. 2013).
            p However, when you are calibrating these and any other parameters, keep in mind that it is fairly easy to specifyqf values that provide a good fit between simulated and observed stream chemistry data, <u>even when the source    soil nutrient pools are poorly calibrated (too large or too</u> <u>small</u>.
            p Achieving a well-calibrated <u>ecosystem </u>model is an iterative process, requiring numerous simulation runsuntil a set of parameters values is identified that simultaneously provides a good fit between simulated andobserved data for plants, soils and streams, i.e., all C, N and H2O pools and fluxes forwhich good quality observed data are available (recognizing that complete validation is an ideal never reached).
            
            h2#9-0 9.0 - 9.1.1 - Nitrogen Deposition 
            p Atmospheric inputs of wet and dry nitrogen deposition can make a significant contribution to ecosystem nitrogenbudgets, especially in regions influenced by industry and agricultural. It is important to estimate the timingand amounts of wet and dry nitrogen deposition, and its availability for plant uptake and other ecohydrologicalprocesses. Such estimates are complicated by time lags associated with dry deposition of nitrogen on leaves andother surfaces, and subsequent flushing into the soil during precipitation events.
            p VELMA version 1.0 modeled daily atmospheric inputs of wet and dry deposition as a function of the annualatmospheric input and the fraction of annual rain that occurs at a given day.
            p VELMA version 2.0 models atmospheric nitrogen deposition based on the following assumptions:
            ol 
                li The daily rate of atmospheric N deposition (wet + dry) is the same every day of the year, i.e., annual total Ndeposition/365 = daily N deposition
                li Daily N deposition (Nin) accumulates on leaves &amp; other surfaces (NinBank) until a liquidprecipitation (rain + snowmelt) event.
                li Precipitation events wash a fraction of NinBank (throughfall N) into the surface soil layer's inorganicN pool. This fraction (0-1) varies as a nonlinear (asymptotic) function of leaf biomass and daily precipitationamount, such that grid cells having higher leaf biomass have disproportionately lower throughfall N at loweramounts of precipitation. Furthermore, N stored in NinBank becomes depleted past a certain upperthreshold (asymptote) of daily precipitation. Thus, the main difference between this method and VELMA version1.0 is that it can account for observed nonlinear threshold behavior of throughfall as a function of leaf areaand precipitation amount.
                li Currently, daily Nin is composed of NH4 + NO3 deposition, and Nin transferred from the NinBankto the surface soil layer is to the ammonium pool in Layer0 (NH4 and NO3 will be modeledseparately in a future version of VELMA).

            p The VELMA v1.0 subroutine for plant nitrogen uptake is described by Abdelnour et al. (2011). VELMA v2.0 generallyfollows the same subroutine, but includes important changes to several components affecting nitrogen uptake:
            ul
                li Uptake of NH4 and NO3 is now modeled explicitly, using pool-specific Michaelis- Mentenequations.
                li The temperature response function for plant N uptake is now based on a quadratic equation described byRastetter et al. (1991).
                li In VELMA v1.0 a constant root fraction parameter was applied to total plant biomass to indirectlysimulate effects of successional changes in root biomass on N uptake. VELMA v2.0 includes a leaf-stem-root (LSR)subroutine that explicitly models root biomass dynamics and consequent effects on NH4 and NO3uptake.
                li Simulated total N uptake per day is allocated to leaf, stem and root tissues according to specified fractionsper tissue.
                li Phenological controls on plant nitrogen uptake constrain when nitrogen uptake can occur.
                li The nonlinear (Weibull) function in VELMA v1.0 for simulating the effect of forest stand age on N uptake hasbeen removed. This and other age-related effects in VELMA v2.0 are now modeled as a consequence of successionalchanges in the availabilities of nitrogen and water.
                li The VELMA v2.0 plant N uptake subroutine must be set up and calibrated for each cover species/types within awatershed.

            p To calibrate the N allocation parameters described in this section, we recommend constructing an annual plantbiomass N budget(s) for all four LSR tissues per cover type. Observed data and estimates can usually be found inthe literature for this. For example:
            ul
                li Leaf litterfall data can be used to estimate annual leaf NPP, usually as dry weight or carbon, so you will alsoneed C/N data to calculate annual N uptake.
                li Data for above- and belowground stem biomass growth can be obtained from tree- ring data and allometric biomassequations for forest cover types, or from "destructive" biomass harvest methods in grasslands or agriculturalplots.

            h2#12-0 12.0 Plant Mortality 
            p VELMA v.2.0 has a new plant biomass mortality function, replacing the linear mortality function in v1.0(Abdelnour et al. 2011). The new mortality function was initially developed for forest vegetation but we havefound that it applies just as well to other cover types, including nonwoody species such as grasslands andagricultural crops.
            p The mortality function is based on the following observations and assumptions:
            ul
                li The ratio of mortality/NPP during succession is nonlinear. For example, in regrowing forest stands, observedincreases in stem biomass require that stem NPP exceeds stem mortality until steady state is reached.
                li A logistic function provides sufficient flexibility to capture temporal changes in the relationship betweenmortality and NPP during succession. Specifically, a logistic function is used to describe nonlinear changes ina tissue's litterfall/NPP ratio vs. stand age, where "tissue" can represent leaf, aboveground stem, belowgroundstem, or root biomass. In practice, total plant biomass (or aboveground stem biomass) serves as a proxy forstand age.
                li For example, using VELMA's parameter naming convention, mortalityAgStemCarbon / nppAgStemCarbon = C / (1 + A * exp^(-B * plantBiomassCarbon))
                li Rearranging, mortalityAgStemCarbon = nppAgStemCarbon * C / (1 + A * exp^(-B * plantBiomassCarbon))
            p For example, the figures below show results obtained by applying the logistic mortality function to a riparianhardwood forest. The left figure shows changes in the ratio of belowground stem mortality/NPP vs. total stembiomass (proxy for stand age). The right figure shows simulated temporal changes in simulated belowground stembiomass and total plant biomass. Adjustment of the mortality function parameters can be used to flatten orsteepen the asymptotic trends in biomass, according to chronosequence data. The mortality function must beapplied to all four of VELMA's plant tissues (results for leaf, aboveground stem and fine root biomass are notshown here).

            p Decomposition of soil organic matter is a key process in VELMA, controlling the rate at which dead organicC and N pools (detritus and humus) are converted to inorganic C and N pools (CO2, NH4, NO3,DON and DOC).
            p VELMA v2.0 has a new decomposition model based on Potter et al. (1993). In the Potter model,microbially-mediated decomposition of plant and soil organic residues produces CO2, such that
            div.math_formula

            ul
                li i = a specified soil organic matter pool (in VELMA, plant tissue detritus or humus)
                li CO2i = carbon dioxide released by the decomposition of pool i
                li Ci = carbon content (gC/m2) of pool i
                li ki = maximum decay rate constant of pool i
                li Ws = scalar constant (0-2.8) for the effect of soil moisture content on decomposition
                li Ts = scalar constant (0-1) for the effect of temperature on decomposition
                li Me = carbon assimilation efficiency (0 - 1) of microbes We made several modifications to the Potter model forVELMA v2.0:
                li We modified the Potter decomposition equation, above, to apply it to detritus and humus N pools ratherthan C pools. The difference in the C/N ratios of donor and recipient pools are used to estimate total carbondecomposed. Specified fractions of the total carbon decomposed are converted to CO2 and DOC.Similarly, a specified fraction of total decomposed N is converted to DON.
                li We replaced Potter's scalar constant for soil temperature (Ts) with a nonlinear function describing thefraction (0 - 1) of the maximum decay rate (Ki) versus soil temperature (oC, perlayer). See section 11.3 for a description of this nonlinear temperature function, which is also used in theplant N uptake subroutine.
                li We replaced Potter's scalar constant for soil moisture (Ws) with a nonlinear function describingthe fraction (0 - 1) of the maximum decay rate (Ki) versus layer-specific soil moisture (v/v, per layer).Our soil moisture decomposition function uses a nonlinear Weibull function, which is the same as that applied tothe soil moisture N fixation function (see section 14.0).

            h2#14-0 14.0 Nitrogen-Fixation 
            p <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen" target="_blank">Nitrogen fixation</a> is a process in which nitrogen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_atmosphere" target="_blank">(N2) in the atmosphere</a> is converted
            p <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium" target="_blank">into ammonium (NH4)</a>. In biologicalsystems, N fixation can be carried out by free-living (asymbiotic) microorganisms, or by plant species that havea symbiotic relationship with N- fixing bacteria (<i>Frankia </i>and <i>Rhizobia</i>). Insymbiotic N fixation, plants provide carbohydrates as an energy source to bacteria that in turn supplyNH4 to the host plant.
            p Rates of symbiotic N fixation for soybeans, red alder and other species can sometimes exceed 100 kg ha-1yr-1, an amount similar to agricultural fertilizer applications. Rates for asymbiotic N fixers tend to bemuch lower - for example, &lt;1 kg ha-1 yr-1in some PNW coniferous forests.
            p However, it is important to capture even small N additions, which are important for maintaining and evenincreasing ecosystem N stocks over successional time scales.
            p We added a nitrogen fixation subroutine to VELMA v2.0 that addresses symbiotic and asymbiotic fixation for anycover type (agricultural, grassland, forest, etc.)

            h2#16-0 16.0 Denitrification 
            p Denitrification is the microbially-mediated conversion of nitrate (NO3-) to nitrous oxide(N2O) and nitrogen gas (N2). This process is represented in the red-outlined area in the diagrambelow.
            img(width="193" height="93" alt="image" src="public/Image_103.gif")
            p Nitrate that is not denitrified or taken up by plants can be readily transported to ground and surfacewaters (the high mobility of NO3- in soil is because both are negatively charged). Thus,
            p denitrification can be important for protecting water quality. On the other hand, if denitrification does not goto completion (stops at N2O instead of N2) it can increase atmospheric inputs of N2O, a potentgreenhouse gas.

            h4 Calibration Notes:
            p The denitrification subroutine has been extensively applied to agricultural systems by the NGAS model developers(Parton et al. 2001; Del Grosso et al. 2000 and 2006). The parameter values used in the model seem to be fairlyrobust across the wide range of conditions reported by the authors. When calibrating the denitrificationsubroutine for a new site, we recommend that you initially focus on just two parameters (assuming all thetrue/false options are set up correctly).
            p These are the yellow-highlighted parameters above: denitDiffusivity and setDenitrificationSoilCondition.
            
            p The denitDiffusivity parameter controls the shape of the logistic function that defines the response of"relative denitrification" (0.0 - 1.0) to water filled pore space (WFPS %). Figure 7 in Del Grosso et al. (2000)illustrates this:
            img(width="626" height="407" alt="image" src="public/Image_107.png")
            p Thus, you will need to adjust the denitDiffusivity parameter ("a" in Figure 7) to obtain a response forthe soil texture that is most appropriate for your watershed. You will also need to specify "INTACT" forundisturbed soils. "REPACKED_MEDIUM" or "REPACKED_FINE" refers to soil columns that have been reconstructed inthe laboratory (Del Grosso et al. 2000). You will need to decide if the REPACKED choices are appropriate forcompacted field soils, e.g., under high tillage practices.

            h4 The Forcing Start and End Years Specify When a Simulation CAN Run
            p The VELMA Simulator expects every driver and observed data file specified in the simulation configuration to have1 line of data for each day between the first day of the year specified for the forcing_start parameterand the last day of the year specified for the forcing_end parameter.
            p For example, if forcing_start = 2000 and forcing_end = 2001, each driver or observed data file musthave 366 + 365 lines of data (one for each of the 731 days of years 2000 through 2001).
            p The value specified by forcing_start must be less than or equal to the value of forcing_end.
            h4 The Simulation Start and End Years Specify When a Simulation WILL Run
            p The years that the VELMA Simulator actually runs a simulation for are specified by the syear (start year)and eyear (end year) simulation configuration parameters. It is an error for syear's value to begreater than eyear's, and for either value to lie outside the bounds of the years specified byforcing_start and forcing_end, however syear and eyear may specify a sub-rangewithin that range.
            p For example, if [forcing_start, forcing_end] = [1995, 2010], [syear, eyear] may be [1997, 2010], oreven a single year, like [1998, 1998].
            h4 The Loops Parameter Specifies How Many Times the Simulation Repeats a Run
            p The numberOfLoops parameter defaults to "1", which tells the VELMA Simulator to run the specifiedsimulation from start year to end year once, and then stop. Setting the numberOfLoops parameter to<i>n</i>, (with &gt; 1) tells the VELMA simulator to run the simulation from start year to end year n times in arow, but to only initialize the simulation before the first start-to-end run. In this way, the numberOfLoopsparameter provides a (simplistic) spin-up mechanism. The second start- to-end run after the first willbegin with the simulation's data state where it was at the end of the first start-to-end run, and so on.
            h4  Use the All Parameters Outline Selector to Focus on the Simulation Run Schedule Parameters 
            You can filter the AllParameters tab's parameters table to focus on the simulation run schedule by selecting item "17.0 Simulation RunSchedule" in the outline dropdown selector:
            img(width="614" height="178" alt="image" src="public/Image_108.jpg")
            p You Can Also Review and Set Some of these Values in the Run Parameters Tab
            p Compare circled fields in the Run Parameters tab below with the parameters circled in the All Parameters tableabove. Setting the "Run Simulator From" and "To" fields in the Run Parameters tab sets the values of the syearand eyear parameters. Setting the Run Parameters "Number of Loops" value sets the value of the numberOfLoopsparameter. Note however, that you can only set the forcing_start and forcing_end values in the All Parameterstable. These values are read-only fields in the Run Parameters tab. The screenshot above happens to specify 12loops - i.e. run the simulation [1999, 2003] x12 - that's a significant spin up. Generally speaking, find outhow long one simulation loop takes to run before embarking on that many multiple loops.

            h4 The VELMA Simulator Calculates a Nash-Sutcliffe Value for Runoff
            p Whenever possible, the VELMA simulator automatically computes a Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient for observed vs.simulated annual runoff values. In order to calculate the runoff Nash-Sutcliffe, the simulator must know whichspan of years to include in the calculation, and have observed runoff data for those years available.
            p To ensure that the VELMA simulator is able to compute a meaningful Nash-Sutcliffe value for your simulation run,provide values for the following configuration parameters.
            h4 Set the Observed Runoff Source File
            p Click the All Parameters tab's configuration outline dropdown selector and select item "19.0 Observed DataFiles". The All Parameters table should then look like this:

            p Set the input_runoff parameter to the name of a .csv file containing valid observed runoff data. A validfile has a single column of floating-point data, one day's observed runoff value per row. There must be exactlyas many rows in the file as there are days in the simulation configuration's
            p forcing_start to forcing_end parameter's span of years. (E.g. if forcing_start = 2000 and
            
            p forcing_end = 2001, then there must be 366 + 365 or 731 rows of data in the file.) The specified file's locationis assumed to be the directory specified by the inputDataLocationRootName +inputDatalocationDirName.
            h4 Set the Years to Simulation the Nash-Sutcliffe
            p Click the All Parameters outline dropdown selector again, and this time select item "18.0 Years to ComputeNash-Sutcliffe for Runoff". The All Parameters table should then look like this:
            img(width="629" height="136" alt="image" src="public/Image_111.jpg")
            p The nashSutcliffeStartYearForRunoffStats and nashSutcliffeEndYearForRunoffStats specify the firstand last years of the simulation run that are used to compute the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient. Obviously, thesestart and end year values must be within the range of the simulation run's start and end years as a whole. Forexample, if your simulation runs from 1995 to 2005, you cannot specify years 1980 to 2009 as the span forcomputing the Nash-Sutcliffe.
            h4 The VELMA Simulator Writes the Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient for Runoff to an Output File
            p The VELMA simulator writes the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient for runoff to a file named"NashSutcliffeCoefficients.txt". This is a simple text file, created in the directory specified by thesimulation configuration's intializeOutputDataLocationRoot parameter.
            p The file contains a single line, reporting the Nash-Sutcliffe result like this:
            p Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient=0.8045351825866978 Loop=1 Years=[1969 to 2008]
            h4 The Computed Nash-Sutcliffe Value is Only as Accurate as the Observed Data
            p The auto-computation of the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient for runoff is convenient, but it is only as accurate asthe observed data and year's span allow it to be.
            h2#19-0 19.0 - Observed Data Files 
            p If you want VELMA to graphically display observed stream chemistry and runoff data along with simulated valuesduring a simulation (section 25.0), and calculate the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (section 18.0), youwill need to prepare input files and specify their names in the All Parameters outline drop-down menu forsection "19.0 Observed Data Files":
            img(width="621" height="124" alt="image" src="public/Image_112.jpg")
            p For the input_runoff parameter, specify the name of a file (.csv format) containing daily observedstreamflow (runoff) values in mm/day. The data must be formatted as one value per line in the file, and the filemust have as many lines as there are days between the simulator
            p configuration's specified forcing_start and forcing_end parameter values (see "All Parameters 17.0- Simulation Run Schedule")
            p For the input_chem parameter, specify the name of a file (.csv format) containing observed dailystream chemistry values for DON, NH4, DOC and NO3, <b>in that order</b>! Units are g Nm-2 day-1, or g C m-2 day-1.
            p Both input files must be placed in the simulation configuration's input file directory location(inputDataLocationDirName) and name (inputDataLocationRootName). These input data parameters canbe found by selecting "Startups" under the drop-down Filter menu tab (type "input" in the filter for the"Parameter" column if you wish to focus the selection on just these two parameters:

            h2#22-0 22.0 - Cell Data Writer Items
            h4 Cell Data Writers Allow You to Gather Simulation Results for a Specific Grid Location
            p The VELMA simulator automatically provides daily simulation results for various values (e.g. Leaf Biomass),however these daily results are average values that are computed by summing individual cell values and thendividing the sum by the number of cells in the simulation's delineated watershed.
            p To gather daily simulation results for a single, specific cell, you need to add a Cell Data Writerparameterization for that cell to the simulation configuration.
            h4 Adding a Cell Data Writer to a Simulation Configuration
            p Cell Data Writers are optional. Simulation configurations contain zero instances of them by default. When added,they do not change the simulation computations - they are only involved in reporting results.
            p To add a Cell Data Writer to your simulation configuration:
            p Click the "Edit"  "Cell Data Writer"  "Add a New Cell Writer" menu item.
            img(width="625" height="192" alt="image" src="public/Image_116.jpg")
            p Clicking "Add a New Cell Writer" opens the Cell Writer Name dialog, which looks like this:
            img(width="400" height="137" alt="image" src="public/Image_117.jpg")
            p Enter a name for your new Cell Data Writer and click "OK".
            p The name must be unique (i.e. no other Cell Data Writer already specified for this simulation configuration canshare the name you specify) and we recommend avoiding whitespace, and punctuation characters (e.g. "(" and ")").An acceptable example name (assuming it's not already in use by another Cell Data Writer might be"Probe_Point_1" or maybe "Outlet_Cell".
            h4 Configuring a Cell Data Writer's Parameters
            p After you click OK in the Cell Data Writer's naming dialog, the VELMA GUI adds the Cell Data Writer to thesimulation configuration, and sets the All Parameters tab's filters to display only the parameters of thenewly-added Cell Data Writer.
            p Assuming we named our new Cell Data Writer "Probe_Point_1" and clicked OK, the VELMA GUI would look like thisafterwards:
            img(width="625" height="143" alt="image" src="public/Image_118.jpg")
            p Notice, in passing, that the configuration outline does <i>not </i>automatically get set by the GUI. In theexample screen capture above, it displays "0.0 All Configuration Parameters" - which is not what is beingdisplayed in the parameterization table. This behavior is harmless.
            h4 A Cell Data Writer has only 3 parameters, but they must all be set correctly: none are optional. 
            p Set theinitializeActiveJdays parameter to the Julian days that you want data reported for. If you want datareported on every day of the year (this is the most common case) set the initializeActiveJdays value tobe "1-366". (The 366 avoids missing the last day in any leap years that occur in the simulation run.)
            p If you only want data reported on specific days of the year, enter the Julian Day values as a comma-separatedlist (e.g. "1, 90, 180, 270" reports data on days 1, 90, 180 and 270). You may specify an inclusive range ofdays by separating a start-day value from an end-day value by a dash (e.g. ("1, 90-180, 270" reports data ondays 1, days 90 through 180, and on day 270).
            p Set the cellX parameter's value to the X-coordinate (i.e. column value) of the cell you want data reportedfor. The valid range is from 0 (the leftmost column) to (number of columns - 1).
            p Set the cellY parameter's value to the Y-coordinate (i.e. row value) of the cell you want data reportedfor. The valid range is from 0 (the topmost row) to (number of rows - 1).
            h4 Cell Data Writer Output is A Comma-Separated Values File
            p The VELMA simulator creates 1 .csv file for each valid Cell Data Writer parameterization in the simulationconfiguration .xml file.
            p Cell Data Writer output files are written to the Results Data Location folder. Their filenames always begin withthe prefix "Cell_" and contain the linear index, x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the cell they contain data for(e.g. Cell_i2873_x35_y33.csv).
            p Each row of a Cell Data Writer output file contains results data for a specific loop, year and Julian day duringthe simulation run. The file's columns contain the specific results. The header row of the file specifies thecontents of each column. Note that some columns contain data that never varies (e.g. the DEM_Elevation(m)column reports the cell's elevation - which is always the same value.)
            h4 Cell Data Writers and Spatial Data Writers are Different, but Complementary
            p A Cell Data Writer reports all the results data available for a specific cell on user-specified days. A SpatialData Writer reports a specific result for all the cells in the simulation watershed on user-specified days. Bothare optional for simulation runs.
            h2#23-0 23.0 - Spatial Data Writer Items 
            h4 Spatial Data Writers Report a Simulation Result for Every Cell in the Simulation Grid
            p Spatial Data Writers are how the VELMA simulation provides spatially-explicit results output.
            p Spatial Data Writers are layer- and result-specific. You must configure separate spatial data writerparameterizations for each result type you will to output, and for layer of that result type. (E.g. to getspatial data output for the Root Biomass pool layers 3 and 4, you would need to add and configure two separateSpatial Data Writer parameterizations to your simulation configuration.
            h3#23-1 23.1 - Spatial Data Writer Items by Model Type
            h4 Adding a Spatial Data Writer to a Simulation Configuration
            p Spatial Data Writers are optional. Simulation configurations contain zero instances of them by default. Whenadded, they do not change the simulation computations - they only report results.
            p To add a Spatial Data Writer to your simulation configuration:
            p Click the "Edit"  "Spatial Data Writer"  "Add a New Spatial Writer".
            img(width="626" height="177" alt="image" src="public/Image_119.jpg")
            p Clicking "Add a New Spatial Writer" opens the Spatial Writer Type and Name dialog which looks like this:
            img(width="400" height="147" alt="image" src="public/Image_120.jpg")
            p Leave the Spatial Data Writer Type selector set to "SpatialDataWriter".
            p The Spatial Data Writer Name must be unique (i.e. no other Spatial Data Writer already specified for thissimulation configuration can share the name you specify). Avoid whitespace and punctuation characters (e.g. "("and ")"). As an example, here are a couple of acceptable
            p names (assuming they're not already in use by another Spatial Data Writer, and the Spatial Data Writer we'readding will report layer 3 root biomass; "Root_Biomass_Layer_3" and "Root_L3".
            h3#23-2 23.2 - Spatial Data Writer Items Data Sources
            h4 Configuring a Spatial Data Writer's Parameters
            p After you click OK in the Spatial Data Writer's Type and Name dialog, the VELMA GUI adds the Spatial Data Writerto the simulation configuration, and sets the All Parameters tab's filters to display only the parameters of thenewly-added Spatial Data Writer.
            p Assuming we named our new Spatial Data Writer "Root_Biomass_Layer_3" and clicked OK, the VELMA GUI would looklike this afterwards:
            img(width="625" height="207" alt="image" src="public/Image_121.jpg")
            p Notice, in passing, that the configuration outline does not automatically get set by the GUI. In the examplescreen capture above, it displays "0.0 All Configuration Parameters" - which is not what is being displayed inthe parameterization table. This behavior is harmless.
            p A Spatial Data Writer has 7 parameters. None are optional, but one (modelClass) is set automatically bythe GUI, and two others (allowNonWatershedCellValues and trimOutputToWatershedBoundary) default toreasonable values automatically. The remaining 4 parameters specify when this parameterization writes itsspecified spatial data source to file, and what that spatial data source should be.
            h4 The Spatial Data Sources Parameter Specifies What Data Is Written
            p Set the initializeSpatialDataSources parameter to the name of the spatial data source you want to reportresults for. The name is case-sensitive, and must exactly match a name from the Table of Spatial Data Sourcesgiven below. Be careful to avoid leading or trailing whitespace when you enter the spatial data sources name;leading or trailing whitespace can "break" the simulation configuration.
            p If the spatial data source you choose is multi-layered (see the table), you may (in some instances, <i>must</i>)explicitly specify the layer you wish to write. Specify an explicit layer by adding it, comma-separated, afterthe spatial data source name. The range of valid layer numbers is [1 to 4].
            p For example: "BIOMASS_ROOT_N" specifies the spatial data source name for biomass root, and"BIOMASS_ROOT_N, 2" specifies biomass root data, layer 2 (enter these, and all parameterization values,<i><b>without </b></i>the surrounding quotation (") marks).
            h3#23-3 23.3 - Spatial Data Writer Items Core Scheduling
            h4 The Three "InitializeActive…" Parameters Specify When Data Is Written
            p Select "23.3 Spatial Data Writer Items Core Scheduling" from the All Parameters drop-down outline selector menu:
            
            img(width="621" height="140" alt="image" src="public/Image_122.jpg")
            p Set the initializeActiveLoops, initializeActiveYears and initializeActiveJdays parametervalues to the loop numbers, years and Julian day values that you want the Spatial Data Writer to write resultsfor.
            p Any specified Loop numbers, years or Julian days that are "beyond bounds" are ignored. I.e. if the simulationconfiguration specifies 3 loops, and the Spatial Data Writer initializeActiveLoops value is set to 4, nodata will ever be written. It is an error to specify negative numbers for Loop, Year or Jday parameters.
            p [TIP: Setting an initializeActiveLoops value greater than the number of loops the simulation configurationspecifies run is an unintuitive yet handy way to temporarily "shut off" a spatial data writer's output withoutremoving it from the simulation configuration.]
            p You may specify more than one value by separating values with commas, and you may specify an inclusive range ofvalues by separating the start and end values by dashes.
            p (E.g. specifying "1, 3-7, 12" for initializeActiveLoops would allow the spatial data writer towrite data in loops 1, loops 3 through 7, and loop 12 - assuming the simulation configuration's numberOfLoopsparameter is set to 12 or more.)
            h4 You May Emphasize the Watershed Cells, or Not
            p When the allowNonWatershedCellValues parameter is set false, its spatial data writer writes anycell value outside the watershed as NO_DATA (the value "-9999.0"). The default value is false,which makes it easy to discern the watershed's delineation in the results file. If you want the results file toinclude every cell value, regardless of whether a given cell is in or out of the watershed delineation, set thisparameter to true.
            h3#23-4 23.4 - Spatial Data Writer Items Output Map Size
            h4 You May Reduce the Dimensions of the Results Grid File
            p Select "23.4 Spatial Data Writer Items Output Map Size" from the All Parameters drop-down outline selector menu:
            
            img(width="622" height="107" alt="image" src="public/Image_123.jpg")
            p When trimOutputToWatershedBoundary is set false, the spatial data writer writes a results file withthe same grid dimensions at the simulation configuration's DEM file. This (default value) make it easy to overlySpatial Data Writer output results on top of the DEM, cover Id map, or soil Id map files. When set totrue, the spatial data writer writes a results file that contains only the cells within the boundingrectangle of the delineated watershed. Depending upon the size of the watershed relative to the overall DEM,this may result in Spatial Data Writer files that are smaller, and easier to review "by hand".
            p [TIP: Spatial Data Writer output results files are not really meant for "manual" review (e.g. via Notepad or asimilar simple text editor). The choice of the Grid ASCII format was for ease of use with GIS systems, and sothat they could be readily "fed back" into the VELMA Simulator as subsequent initialization input. However,there's nothing wrong with opening a results file in a text editor or spreadsheet for a quick sanity check.]
            p To reduce the Dimensions of the Results Grid File, click the All Parameters tab's configuration outline dropdownselector and select "23.4 Spatial Data Writer Items Output Map Size".
            img(width="623" height="106" alt="image" src="public/Image_124.jpg")
            h4 Spatial Data Writer Output is a Grid ASCII File
            p The VELMA simulator creates 1 .asc file each time a given Spatial Data Writer is triggered (based on its activeLoops, Years and Jdays parameter settings).
            p Spatial Data Writer output files are written to the Results Data Location folder. Their filenames always beginwith the prefix "Spatial_" and include the name of the spatial data source and layer number of the data theycontain. The dimensions of the Grid ASCII file match those of the simulation configuration's DEM .asc file,unless the trimOutputToWatershedBoundary parameter was set "true"; in that case, the dimensions of theSpatial Data Writer output file are those of the bounding box of the simulation run's delineated watershed.
            p Each data value in the output .asc file contains the value for the specified data source for a particular cell,on the particular loop, year and Julian day during the simulation run that the output file was written.
            p Spatial Data Writers and Spatial Data Writers are Different, but Complementary
            p A Spatial Data Writer reports a specific result for all the cells in the simulation watershed on user-specifieddays. A Spatial Data Writer reports all the results data available for a specific cell on user-specified days.Both are optional for simulation runs.
            h4 Table of Spatial Data Sources
            p This table lists the available spatial data source name and their layer requirements.
            h5 SpatialDataSource Keyword means:
            p The spatial data source keyword names that are valid values for the
            p initializeSpatialDataSources parameter value of a Spatial Data Writer's parameterization.
            ul "Type" means:
                li Accessor = Spatial Data that is not directly stored in a spatial data pool object.
                li Direct = Spatial Data that is directly stored in a spatial data pool object.
                li Buffered = Spatial Data directly stored in a spatial data pool object, but only when a Spatial Data Writerrequires it.
            p (In practice, you can ignore what type a spatial data source is when you are configuring a Spatial Data Writer.)
            
            ul  Can Sum Column? means:
                li N/A = Not applicable
                li No = The data cannot be summed: if MultiLayer is "YES" for this type of data, then a layer must beexplicitly provided in the initializeSpatialDataSources parameter value.
                li Optional = If MultiLayer is "YES" for this type of data and no explicit layer number is indicated in theinitializeSpatialDataSources parameter value, the value reported will be the sum of all layer values at a givencell's location.

            h2#24-0 24.0 - Disturbance Items 
            p Understanding how disturbances such as harvest, fire and fertilization affect ecosystem services has been a majormotivation in the development of VELMA. For example, how do disturbances such as forest harvest or theapplication of agronomic fertilizers affect hydrological and biogeochemical processes controlling water qualityand quantity, carbon sequestration, production of greenhouse gases, etc.? Abdelnour et al. (2011, 2013) havealready demonstrated the use of VELMA v1.0 to simulate the effects of forest clearcutting on ecohydrologicalprocesses that regulate a variety of ecosystem services.
            p With the addition of a tissue-specific plant biomass (LSR) simulator and an enhanced GUI, VELMA v2.0significantly expands the detail, flexibility, and ease of use for simulating disturbance effects. Currentlyavailable disturbance models include:
            ul
                li BurnDisturbanceModel  effects of fire
                li GrazeDisturbanceModel  effects of grazing
                li FertilizeLsrDisturbanceModel  effects of fertilizer applications
                li HarvestLsrDisturbanceModel  effects of biomass harvest
            p Each of these disturbance models specifies where and when a disturbance event will occur. The Burn, Graze andHarvest models have options for specifying how much of each plant tissue and detritus pool (leaves, stems,roots) will be removed and where it goes (offsite and/or to a specified onsite C and N pools). The Fertilizemodel has options for applying nitrogen as ammonium, nitrate, urea and/or manure.
            p Requirements for implementing a disturbance model include (1) a grid ASCII map of your watershed and associatedparameter specifications that determine where and when a disturbance will occur, and (2) parameterspecifications that determine which plant biomass and detritus pools will be affected, and the fraction of eachpool burned, grazed or harvested and its destination. Portions of harvested aboveground stem biomass can beexported offsite or transferred to the aboveground stem detritus pool.
            p Sections 24.1 - 24.3 describe how to select a disturbance model type and specify parameter values to simulatewhere, when and how disturbances occur. You can set up as many disturbance types and events as you may require.
            
            p However, we first want to step through an example on the next four pages that illustrate how VELMA's newdisturbance models work. We've chosen the Harvest disturbance model for this example because it illustrates keyconcepts shared by most of the other disturbance models, particularly with regard to how disturbances can bekeyed to the LSR (Leaves-Stems-Root) plant biomass model. We recommend that you look over the details of thisexample before proceeding to sections 24.1 - 24.3.

            //- p The Harvest LSR Disturbance has 2 sets of fraction parameters: harvest and offsite.
            //- p There is one harvest and one offsite parameter for each pool, for a total of 8 individual parameters. Each parameter's value must be in the range [0.0, 1.0].

            p In order to use filtering, the user must have define a Filter Map: a Grid Ascii map with ID numbers for cell data values. The user specifies this map&#39;s name as <code>FilterMapFullName</code> parameter value.
            p (Leaving the <code>FilterMapFullName</code> unspecified indicates &quot;No Filtering&quot; to the Harvest LSR Disturbance.)
             
            p When a filter file is specified the disturbance only occurs for the filter Ids cells the user specifies in the <code>initializeFilterIds</code> parameter&#39;s values;multiple filter Id values may be specified, but not number ranges. The disturbance uses the specified filter Ids, plus the data in the filter map specified by the <code>filterMapFullName</code> parameter to determine which cells are eligible for harvested.
             
            p Here is an example spedfication for the spatial/cover parameters:
            code initializeFilterlds = 1, 2 
            code filterMapFullName = exampleFilterIDFile.asc
            p Note: these example filter Id values,and the values in the exampleFilterIDFile have no relation to the cover Ids.
            p Using this filtering scheme and the cover ID example from the previous slide, the selection logic is: 
            ol 
                li Find the subset of cells in the filter map that match the filter ids specified by initializeFilterlds.
                li Consider other spatial-selection (e.g cover Ids) based only on that subset of cells.

            h4 Calibration Notes
            p Make sure that the disturbance models you have set up are working correctly. Are disturbance events occurringwhen and where you want them to, are the correct amounts of biomass being harvested/burned/grazed, and are thecorrect amounts and forms of fertilizer being applied. For a first check, click VELMA's GUI "Chart" tab at anytime during a simulation, then click the
            p drop-down menu button located near the lower left corner of the screen, then select an appropriate spatial datadisplay option (see section "25.0 - Runtime Chart Display Scale" for details").
            p For example, by selecting the "Harvest Spatial Data" menu item you can see daily and year-to- date summaries ofharvest events and their effects on various biomass tools. The two figures below show year-end summaries ofharvest events for consecutive years, 2000 and 2001. In 2000 there were no harvests (top figure: top row, middleframe). In 2001 there were several fairly large harvest events (bottom figure: top row, middle frame). Acomparison of the other frames in top and bottom figures reveals changes in plant biomass, detritus, soilorganic matter, and cover age following harvest events.
            p An examination of VELMA's daily and annual output files (csv format) provides a more quantitative check ofdisturbance events.

            h2#25-0 25.0 - Runtime Chart Display Scale
            p VELMA has powerful visualization capabilities built into it, hence the model's name - Visualizing Ecosystem LandManagement Assessments. To see a list of visualization options, select the VELMA GUI "Chart" tab at any timeduring a simulation, then click the drop-down menu button ( <img width="19" height="24" alt="image"        src="public/Image_158.gif")) located near the lower left corner of the screen, and select a displayoption. Each option dynamically displays daily changes in one or more output variables. The screenshot belowshows the lower half of possible visualization options:
            img(width="599" height="488" alt="image" src="public/Image_159.jpg")
            p For example, the "Soil Moisture Spatial" visualization displays runtime daily changes in spatial patterns of soilmoisture (% saturation) for four soil layers for a 20-ha watershed on the day currently being simulated. Ascreenshot for a particular day is shown below. The lower third of display is a running graphical summary ofdaily changes in soil moisture per soil layer from January 1 up to the date currently simulated. A new view isgenerated at the beginning of each calendar year). A variety of hardwired display formats are used for differentoutput variables.
            img(width="612" height="652" alt="image" src="public/Image_160.jpg")
            p You can save daily screenshots as .png files by clicking the "Snapshot" button (located near the middle of themenu bar at the bottom of the screenshot, above). You can also save a series of daily images by clicking the"Capture Images Daily" checkbox. After a simulation is completed, third-party software can be used to stitchtogether a time series of saved .png screenshots to make a time-lapse movie. However, note that saving daily.png images for long simulations can fill large amounts of disk space.
            p You can use the VELMA GUI's All Parameters tab to review and change the settings for display parameterscontrolling minimum (min) and maximum (max) values for the y-axis and range color bar. To locate all displayparameters, select the "25.0 Runtime Chart Display Scale" item from the All Parameters drop-down menu button:
            
            img(width="625" height="134" alt="image" src="public/Image_161.jpg")
            p Different runtime display charts use different subsets of the display parameters. Unfortunately, nothing listedunder "All Parameters 25.0 Runtime Chart Display Scale" indicates which display parameters belong to aparticular runtime display chart. Therefore, we have constructed the table below so that users can associateruntime display chart names with the display parameters used by that chart.
            p For example, if you want to adjust VELMA's "Annual Plot" display for soil humus, you would find "Annual Plot"under the "Display Selector Name" column in the table below, copy "maxHumusDayDisplay" and paste it inthe "Parameter" search window in the VELMA GUI's All Parameters view. Hit your keyboard's "Enter" key and youshould see "maxHumusDayDisplay" under "Parameter column. Specify the value you want. Repeat for theprocess for the "minHumusDayDisplay" parameter. [Note: you cannot change the display parameterizationsduring a simulation run. Currently, the VELMA GUI does not allow runtime display scales to change dynamicallyduring simulation runs. Prior to starting a simulation, you must set the display parameters for any chart youwill use during a simulation.]
