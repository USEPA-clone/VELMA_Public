<p >The original version of VELMA
    (henceforth referred to as version 1.0 or v1.0) has been previously described (Abdelnour et al. 2011, 2013).
    VELMA version 2.0 (v2.0), described herein, includes a number of important changes that are designed to
    facilitate green infrastructure and ecosystem service applications of interest to communities, tribes, land
    managers and policy makers. In summary, this required:</p>
<p >- Enhancements to the
    hydrological and biogeochemical submodels to better simulate effects of green infrastructure management
    practices on the fate and transport of water, nutrients and toxics across multiple spatial and temporal scales -
    plots to basins, days to centuries (details below).</p>
<p >- A new graphical-user-interface
    (GUI) to assist novice and experienced model users in scenario development, model calibration, and visualization
    and interpretation of results.</p>
<p >- Rewriting the program code in
    Java / Eclipse to facilitate debugging and open source (community) model development. The version 1.0 Processing
    code is no longer supported.</p>
<p >- A new user manual (this
    document) that provides a step-by-step guide to setting up and applying VELMA v2.0.</p>
<p>Details follow on changes to the hydrological and biogeochemical submodels in VELMA v2.0:</p>
<p >1) Hydrological submodel:</p>
<p >a. Evapotranspiration (ET)
    submodel revised to include</p>
<p >i. effect of leaf biomass
    (surrogate for leaf area); replaces submodel for simulating effect of stand age on ET (Abdelnour et al. 2011)
</p>
<p >ii. effect of stand age on ET in
    forest systems</p>
<p >2) Biogeochemical submodel:</p>
<p >a. Single land cover simulator
    revised to include multiple land cover types within watersheds</p>
<p >b. Plant Soil Model (PSM)
    approach for simulating plant biomass in aggregate (Stieglitz et al. 2006; Abdelnour et al. 2013) replaced by a
    Leaf-Stem-Root (LSR) submodel that simulates carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics for leaves, aboveground stems
    belowground stems, and fine roots (&lt;2 mm diameter).</p>
<p >c. Decomposition submodel
    replaced by Potter et al. (1993) submodel and further adapted to work with LSR submodel.</p>
<p >d. New plant biomass mortality
    submodel based on changes in NPP/mortality ratio during succession</p>
<p >e. Plant nitrogen uptake submodel
    modified to include fine root biomass dynamics</p>
<p >f. Nitrification and
    denitrification submodels revised based on unpublished corrections to Del Grosso et al. (2001)</p>
<p >g. New nitrogen fixation submodel
</p>
<p >h. New atmospheric nitrogen
    deposition submodel that accounts for time lag between dry deposition on leaf surfaces and subsequent
    precipitation-driven transfer to plant-available soil nitrogen pools</p>
<p >i. Improved disturbance submodel
    and GUI for scheduling and simulating effects of fertilization, harvest, grazing and fire on ecohydrological
    processes</p>
<p >3) New spatial climate simulator
    that includes effects of elevation, slope and aspect on pixel-specific temperature and precipitation</p>
<p >4) Supporting submodels</p>
<p >a. DEM processor (PDEM) rewritten
    in Java with new GUI</p>
<p >b. New Python software (VELMA
    Raster Rally GIS toolbox) for preparing spatial data files (DEM, land cover, plant biomass, nutrient pools and
    soil type maps) for VELMA initialization</p>
