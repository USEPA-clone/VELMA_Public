<h1>I. Introduction</h1>
    <p><span><img width="680" height="1" alt="image" src="Image_003.png" /></span></p>
    <p>VELMA - Visualizing Ecosystems for Land Management Assessments - is a spatially distributed, eco- hydrological
        model that links a land surface hydrology model with a terrestrial biogeochemistry model for simulating the
        integrated responses of vegetation, soil, and water resources to interacting stressors. For example, VELMA can
        simulate how changes in climate and land use interact to affect soil water storage, surface and subsurface
        runoff, vertical drainage, evapotranspiration, vegetation and soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics, and transport
        of nitrate, ammonium, and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen to water bodies. VELMA differs from other
        existing eco-hydrology models in its simplicity, flexibility, and theoretical foundation. The model has a
        user-friendly Graphics User Interface (GUI) for easy input of model parameter values. In addition, advanced
        visualization of simulation results can enhance understanding of results and underlying concepts. VELMA's
        visualization and interactivity features are packaged in an open-source, open-platform programming environment
        (<span>Java / Eclipse</span>). The development team for VELMA version 2.0 includes Dr. Bob McKane and coworkers
        at the</p>
    <p>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Western Ecology Division, Dr. Marc Stieglitz and coworkers at the Georgia
        Institute of Technology, and Dr. Feifei Pan at the University of North Texas.</p>
    <p>1.1. Application of VELMA to Various Ecosystems</p>
    <p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010WR010165/full">VELMA's hydrological and biogeochemical
            submodels have been verified for simulating the effects of changes in climate and land use on streamflow,
            stream chemistry, and ecosystem carbon and nitrogen dynamics (Abdelnour et al. 2011, 2013;
        </a><span>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010WR010165/full</span><a
            href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012WR012994/full">;
        </a><span>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012WR012994/full</span><a
            href="http://www.lternet.edu/lter-sites">). To date, we have calibrated VELMA for a wide range of major
            ecosystem types across North America, focusing primarily on data-rich sites in the National Science
            Foundation's Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network
            (</a><span>http://www.lternet.edu/lter-sites</span>)<span>. These ecosystem types include temperate forest
            LTER sites in Oregon, New Hampshire, and North Carolina; the Konza Prairie LTER in Kansas; agricultural
            watersheds in the Chesapeake Bay and Willamette River Basin; and the arctic tundra LTER in Alaska.</span>
    </p>
    <p>1.2. Decision Support</p>
    <p>We developed VELMA to help support two recent sustainability initiatives by the EPA Office of Research and
        Development: the Safe and Sustainable Waters Research Program (SSWR) and the Sustainable and Healthy Communities
        Research Program (SHC). Our goal is to provide comprehensive decision support tools that can help communities,
        tribes, land managers and policy makers address present needs without compromising the ability of society and
        the environment to meet the economic, social and environmental needs of future generations. <b>Key decision
            support goals are to (1) assess the effectiveness of natural and engineered green infrastructure for
            protecting water quality of streams and estuaries, and (2) quantify the ecosystem goods and services that
            ecosystems provide for humans.</b></p>
    <p>VELMA was recently redesigned (version 2.0, described herein) to better address both these goals. Green
        infrastructure (GI) involves the establishment of riparian buffers (streamside vegetation), cover crops,
        constructed wetlands, and other measures to intercept, store and transform nutrients, toxics and other
        contaminants that might otherwise reach surface and ground waters. GI enhancements have also strengthened model
        capabilities for quantifying how alternative land use and policy scenarios affect tradeoffs among important
        ecosystem services - that is, the capacity of an ecosystem to provide clean water, flood control, food and
        fiber, climate (greenhouse gas) regulation, fish and wildlife habitat, among others (Millennium Ecosystem
        Assessment 2005). Model development has been guided by the principle of parsimony to enable VELMA to efficiently
        address multiple spatial and temporal scales - plots to basins, days to centuries.</p>
    <p><a href="http://eco.confex.com/eco/2012/webprogram/Paper37040.html">While VELMA has already proven useful for
            quantifying how such ecosystem services interact and respond in concert to environmental changes
            (</a><span>http://eco.confex.com/eco/2012/webprogram/Paper37040.html</span><a
            href="http://eco.confex.com/eco/2010/techprogram/P25975.HTM">;
        </a><span>http://eco.confex.com/eco/2010/techprogram/P25975.HTM</span>)<span>, it is important to also quantify
            the economic and social impacts associated with such changes. Therefore, we are collaborating with Oregon
            State University to link VELMA with ENVISION, a well-established decision support tool that integrates
            landscape GIS layers, ecological models, economic valuation models, and user-defined stressor
            scenarios</span></p>
    <p><a href="http://envision.bioe.orst.edu/">(</a><span>http://envision.bioe.orst.edu/</span>). The recently
        completed Envision-VELMA linkage is described in our SHC</p>
    <p>2.1.4.2 product for September 2014.</p>
    <p><span>To date, </span>we have prototyped ENVISION for the 30,000 km2</span><a
            href="http://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/node/1019"> Willamette River Basin in Oregon to examine how
            alternative scenarios (2010 - 2060) of land use and human population growth affect &quot;bundled&quot;
            ecosystem services. This work examines the capacity of the landscape to support projected increases in human
            populations under alternative growth plans (smart growth, unmanaged growth, and status quo) and consequent
            trade-offs in provisioning of agricultural and forest products, clean supplies of water, carbon
            sequestration, and habitat for wildlife populations (Bolte et al. in review; Bolte et al. 2011,
        </a><span>http://www.thesolutionsjournal.com/node/1019</span>).</p>
    <p>1.3. Products and Impacts</p>
    <p>The major product of this research will be a set of broadly applicable decision support tools that enable
        communities, client offices and other stakeholders to (1) assess the effectiveness of green infrastructure
        options for protecting water quality, (2) quantify tradeoffs among ecosystem goods and services associated with
        alternative land use decision scenarios, and (3) generate community sustainability indicators and their
        trajectories to help communities balance environmental, economic and social criteria over timescales relevant to
        immediate needs and long-term (decades to centuries) planning goals.</p>
    <p>Using a participatory planning and outreach approach that integrates researchers, stakeholders and decision
        makers, we will address several questions pertinent to community sustainability:</p>
    <p>-Can methodologies be developed to quantify and value ecosystem services, so that this natural capital can be
        better accounted for in decisions that affect the supply of the goods and services upon which human well-being
        depends?</span></p>
    <p>-What are the uncertainties associated with various decision options? Is there an optimal “decision path” for
        restoring the natural capital needed to sustainably support communities dependent on resource-based economies,
        such as the agricultural, forest, and fishing industries?</span></p>
    <p>-Can those factors that have the greatest potential to improve future trajectories of ecosystem services and
        human well-being be identified? For example, what green and grey infrastructure improvements, carbon and
        nitrogen management practices, and growth and development policies can most effectively be managed to attain a
        sustainable and desirable future?</span></p>
    <p>The linkage of VELMA and ENVISION is intended to provide stakeholders with a user-friendly, visual interface for
        exploring the consequences of alternative climate and land use scenarios on ecosystem service tradeoffs.</p>
    <p>Outputs will be computer-generated visualizations of predicted changes in multiple ecosystem services, both in
        biophysical and economic terms. Our overall goal is to provide a framework for integrated assessments that
        identify policy and management strategies for entire ecosystems and the bundled services they provide, rather
        than piecemeal assessments of individual services.</p>
