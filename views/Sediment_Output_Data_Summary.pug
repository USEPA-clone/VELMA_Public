    | VELMA Sediment Prototype Output Data Summary
  h2
    | Overview
  p
    | The VELMA sediment prototype model simulates transfer of detritus leaf and top-layer humus via lateral movement of surface water.
  p
    | When a VELMA simulation includes the sediment model parameterization, sediment-specific data columns are automatically added in the DailyResults.csv and AnnualResults.csv output files.
  p
    | Sediment-specific data columns are also automatically added in any CellDataWriter .csv output files specified by CellDataWriter parameterization in the configuration.
  p
    | No SpatialDataWriter .asc map files are automatically generated, but users may add SpatialDataWriter parameterizations that specify sediment-specific data to their simulation configurations.

    | Spatially-Explicit Data
  p
    | The sediment model computes and maintains per-simulation-step ("per-day"), spatially-explicit data for detritus leaf and top-layer humus sediment transportation amounts, as well as the delta (flux) of detritus leaf and humus at each cell.

  p
    | The spatially-explicit per-step data may be identified with the following keynames:
  pre
    code
      | DETRITUS_LEAF_SEDIMENT_LATERAL_IN
      | DETRITUS_LEAF_SEDIMENT_LATERAL_OUT
      | DETRITUS_LEAF_SEDIMENT_DELTA
      | HUMUS_SEDIMENT_LATERAL_IN
      | HUMUS_SEDIMENT_LATERAL_OUT
      | HUMUS_SEDIMENT_DELTA

  p
    | Users can generate maps of sediment spatial data values by adding SpatialDataWriter parameterizations to their simulation configuration, and using the keynames above as values for the 
    code
      | initializeSpatialDataSources
    |  parameter.
  p
    | In CellDataWriter .csv files, cell-specific sediment data values for each simulation step are reported in the following columns:
  pre
    code
      | Detritus_Leaf_Sediment_Lateral_In(mm/day)
      | Detritus_Leaf_Sediment_Lateral_Out(mm/day)
      | Detritus_Leaf_Sediment_Delta(mgN/m2/day)
      | Humus_Sediment_Lateral_In(mm/day)
      | Humus_Sediment_Lateral_Out(mm/day)
      | Humus_Sediment_Delta(mgN/m2/day)
      | Sediment_Humus_T1(gN/m2)

  p
    em
      | Note: the
    |  
    code
      | Sediment_Humus_T1
    |  *data column is only available in CellDataWriter output. It cannot be specified as output data for SpatialDataWriter map output. Its 
    em
      | value is the amount of top-layer Humus available in a cell prior to sediment transfer. This value is necessary for VELMA parallel mode runs (and is used by VELMA in that mode), but may otherwise be ignored.
  h3
    | Temporal Data
  p
    | The sediment model computes per-simulation-step ("per-day") "VSA" and "Loss" values for detritus leaf and humus. These values are computed for the entire watershed and are solely applicable for the watershed's outlet location (i.e. the cell coordinates specified by the simulation configuration's 
    code
      | outx
    |  and 
    code
      | outy
    |  coordinates).
  p
    | Their calculation involves distinquishing between "channel" and "NONchannel" cells. To VELMA, a "channel" cell is any cell whose log(flow accumulation value) meets or exceeds a specified threshold.
  p
    strong
      | VSA
    |  is computed as: the sum of all channel-cell Lateral Out amounts, divided by the number of cells in the watershed.
  p
    strong
      | Loss
    |  is computed as: the sum of all NONchannel-to-channel Lateral Out amounts, 
    em
      | plus
    |  VSA, divided by the number of cells in the watershed.
  p
    | The VSA and Loss values are reported in the DailyResults.csv and AnnualResults.csv files in the following data columns:
  pre
    code
      | Detritus_Leaf_Sediment_VSA(gN/m2/day)_Delineated_Average
      | Detritus_Leaf_Sediment_Loss(gN/m2/day)_Delineated_Average
      | Humus_Sediment_VSA(gN/m2/day)_Delineated_Average
      | Humus_Sediment_Loss(gN/m2/day)_Delineated_Average

  p
    | VSA and Loss values are 
    em
      | only
    |  computed for the "final" (
    code
      | outx
    | , 
    code
      | outy
    | ) outlet cell of a simulation configuration 
    em
      | unless
    |  the simulation configuration is run using VelmaSimulatorParallelCmdLine.
    br
    |  A simulation configuration run using JVelma or VelmaSimulatorCmdLine will 
    em
      | not
    |  compute or report sediment VSA and Loss values for sub-reach outlets specified for 
    code
      | initialReachOutlets
    | .
  h3
    | Additional Detailed Temporal Data
  p
    | When the sediment model's 
    code
      | enableCategorizedLossTransfersReport
    |  parameter is set to 
    code
      | true
    | , VELMA reports additional VSA-and-Loss-related values in the results folder's global trace log file (default name "GlobalTraceLog.csv", but user-renamable via the 
    code
      | csvTraceLogFileName
    |  parameter). The addtional values provide details about how the final detritus leaf and humus VSA and Loss values were calculated. This can be useful for understanding how much of a watershed's overal Loss amounts are due to channel-cell transfers versus NONchannel-cell transfers.
  p
    | Be aware that this additional data generates one additional row of output per simulation step in the global trace log .csv file 
    em
      | and
    |  in the global state log .txt file, and that these additional rows are echoed to the simulation's console (whether in JVelma or a command line via 
    code
      | stdout
    | ). For simulations configured to run for many years (i.e. many steps), this may mean the simulation takes appreciably longer to run, as that additional data is written its console, global state, and global trace. It also means that the global state and global trace log files will be larger.
